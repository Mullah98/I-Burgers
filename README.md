# I-Burgers

My second built project. Created a burger menu with plenty of options and a total box which increases/decreases depending on the user selection.
Feel more confident using CSS and HTML. Used online resources to help me a lot with the JavaScript as it was very challenging. 
Putting more time into JavaScript to feel more confident and create more projects
